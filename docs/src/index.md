This package implements 


```@contents
Pages = ["intro.md",
         "gettingstarted.md",
         "acetb_intro.md", 
         "dftbplus_acetb.md",
         "devel.md"]

```

### Building the Documentation

* To build the documentation locally, use the `make.jl` script. Simply switch to `ACEtb/docs` and execute `julia make.jl`
* To publish the documentation to github, use the `publish.sh` script: switch to `ACEtb/docs` and execute `./publish.sh`. This will close the `ACE_gh repository (if it isn't already), the copy into it the website, and git commit, push.
